#+TITLE: ptext: Programmable Plain Text

* Enliven your text
=ptext= allows you to write programmable text documents by mixing code and text.
It allows you to embed arbitrary Racket expressions in a file, making the file runnable to produce another file.

* Usage
An example file, =myfile.pxt=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#lang ptext
!@(define thisyear (date-year (seconds->date (current-seconds))))@!
This is my text document.
It was written in !@thisyear@!, and located in !@(path->string (current-directory))@!.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Running this "program" with
: racket myfile.pxt
produces
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE


This is my text document.
It was written in 2018, and located in /tmp/.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Installation
: git clone https://github.com/LLazarek/ptext.git
: cd ptext
: raco pkg install

* TODOs
- Allow functions to operate on surrounding text.
  - E.g. Replace text in remainder of file.
